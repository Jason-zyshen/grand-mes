# Road Map

## Setup Environment

1. Create a new neo4j database on [neo4j sandbox](https://sandbox.neo4j.com/). Copy the _Bolt URL_, _Username_ and _Password_ from the _Connection Details_ tag.
2. Create a new GRANDstack application with the starter.
   ```bash
   npx create-grandstack-app graph-mes
